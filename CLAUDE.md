# Repository Guidelines — luthien-pbc-site

## Purpose

Public website for Luthien (Public Benefit Corporation). Marketing landing page, QA trial instructions, and future pages.

**Tech stack:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS. No build system. Push to main = live via GitHub Pages.

## Sibling Repos

- **luthien-proxy** (`LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy`): The core product. Backend Python proxy.
- **luthien-org** (`LuthienResearch/luthien-org`): Private org docs, feedback synthesis, user interview notes. Landing page iteration history lives here.
- **luthien_site** (`LuthienResearch/luthien_site`): Jai's Eleventy site at luthienresearch.org. Relationship TBD — this repo may eventually replace or coexist with it.
- **personal-site** (`scottwofford/personal-site`): Scott's personal site. Previous home of the landing page (landing_v8).

## Development Workflow

Same objective workflow as luthien-proxy:

1. Create/switch to feature branch
2. Update `dev/OBJECTIVE.md`
3. Make changes, commit frequently
4. Push to origin, open draft PR
5. When done: update `CHANGELOG.md`, clear `dev/OBJECTIVE.md` and `dev/NOTES.md`, mark PR ready

## Editing Pages

- All pages are self-contained HTML with inline CSS/JS
- Images live in `site/assets/images/`
- Reference images with relative paths: `assets/images/filename.ext`
- No build step — edit HTML directly, push, it's live
- Test locally by opening `site/index.html` in a browser

## Adding New Pages

1. Create `site/new-page/index.html` (directory + index.html for clean URLs)
2. Use the same font imports (Inter + JetBrains Mono from Google Fonts)
3. Use the same color scheme (dark: `#09090b` bg, `#e4e4e7` text, `#22c55e` accent)
4. Link from the main nav if appropriate

## Deployment

- **GitHub Pages** deploys from `site/` directory on the `main` branch
- Push to main = live (via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Custom domain can be added later via `site/CNAME`

## One PR = One Concern

Same rule as luthien-proxy: keep PRs focused. Bug fix? Separate PR. New page? Separate PR.
